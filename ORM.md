# Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

- ORM is a technique that helps you to query and manipulate data from databases using an object-oriented paradigm.

## Advantages of ORM

- ORM can improve development time (good for small projects that require you to develop code in a short time).
- Since we have to write a data model only in 1 place, it is easier to update, maintain, and reuse the code.
- Forces you to write MVC code.
- No need for writing SQL queries.
- No need for database-level changes frequently.
- Most of the work is automated.

## Disadvantages of ORM

- Performance issue with complex queries. (ORM has a tendency to be slow)
- ORM fails to compete against SQL queries for complex queries.
- Integration and learning.

## Examples of ORM

1. Sequelize

- Sequelize is a well known promise-based Node.js ORM, which can be used with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and Postgres.
- Being a promise-based ORM means it supports NodeJS promises.
- Sequelize provides a large set of features to developers and this library has been more famous because of those features.
